> Easier teams and members creation with out of the box integration with Github REST API.

We build a Sitecore hackathon website with functionality that makes it easy for the community to participate and join teams. The website will automatically create your github team under Sitecore Hackathon organization, with a repository named after your team and with Github invitation sent out to all of the team members to join the repository.

We hope the organizors of Sitecore hackathon love this submission as we know it will make life easier for them.
